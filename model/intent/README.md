# Action Classification
This folder contains the code needed to record, train, and test a machine learning model that will predict a single action from a set of actions from your brainwaves. 

**UPDATE**: Now a semi-supervised model augmented with a feature extractor trained on the [EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset](https://www.physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/)
